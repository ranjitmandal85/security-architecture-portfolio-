# 🔐 SIEM Detection Engineering & Log Pipeline Design

## 🔹 Overview
Designed and implemented a **security monitoring architecture** to improve detection visibility, log coverage, and incident response readiness across enterprise infrastructure.

Goal:
> Move from "logs exist" → to → "actionable security detection"

---

## 🔹 Problem Statement

The environment had multiple security tools (firewalls, VPN, IAM, servers), but:

- Logs were not centralized  
- No standardized log format or correlation  
- Detection use-cases were missing or incomplete  
- High noise, low signal (alert fatigue)  
- Limited visibility into user behavior  

**Impact:**
- Security incidents could go undetected  
- SOC lacked actionable insights  

---

## 🔹 Objectives

- Design centralized SIEM architecture  
- Build log ingestion pipeline  
- Create high-value detection use-cases  
- Reduce noise and improve signal quality  
- Enable incident response visibility  

---

## 🔹 Architecture Design

### Design Principles

- Collect logs from critical control points  
- Normalize → Correlate → Detect  
- Focus on identity + access behavior  
- Ensure logs are actionable
