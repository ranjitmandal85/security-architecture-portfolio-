🔹 Title

SIEM Detection Engineering & Log Pipeline Design for Enterprise Security Monitoring

🔹 1. Overview 

In this project, I designed and implemented a security monitoring architecture focused on improving detection visibility, log coverage, and incident response readiness across enterprise infrastructure.

The goal was to move from:

“Logs exist” → to → “Actionable security detection”

🔹 2. Problem Statement

The environment had multiple security tools (firewalls, VPN, IAM, servers), but:

❌ Logs were not centralized
❌ No standardized log format or correlation
❌ Detection use-cases were missing or incomplete
❌ High noise, low signal (alert fatigue)
❌ Limited visibility into user behavior and access misuse

👉 Result:

Security incidents could go undetected
SOC lacked actionable insights
🔹 3. Objectives
Design a centralized SIEM architecture
Build log ingestion pipeline
Create high-value detection use-cases
Reduce noise and improve signal quality
Enable incident response visibility
🔹 4. Architecture Design
🔐 Design Principles
Collect logs from critical control points
Normalize → Correlate → Detect
Focus on identity + access behavior
Ensure logs are actionable, not just stored

🔹 5. Log Pipeline Design
📥 Log Sources Integrated
Firewalls (traffic, threat logs)
VPN (user login, session activity)
IAM / AAA (authentication, authorization)
Windows/Linux (system logs)
Cloud (AWS logs)
🔄 Processing Steps
Collection
Syslog / API ingestion
Parsing
Normalize fields (user, IP, action, timestamp)
Enrichment
Geo-location
User identity mapping
Asset criticality
Indexing
Structured storage in SIEM
🔹 6. Detection Use-Cases (Core of Project)
			🔍 1. VPN Anomaly Detection
			
			Use Case:
			Detect suspicious VPN access patterns
			
			Logic:
			
			Multiple login failures followed by success
			Login from unusual geo-location
			Concurrent logins from different locations
			
			Outcome:
			
			Early detection of compromised credentials
			🔍 2. IAM / AAA Abuse Detection
			
			Use Case:
			Detect misuse of privileged or valid accounts
			
			Logic:
			
			Login outside business hours
			Privilege escalation events
			Access to restricted network segments
			
			Outcome:
			
			Detection of insider threats or compromised accounts
			🔍 3. Firewall Threat Detection
			
			Use Case:
			Identify malicious traffic patterns
			
			Logic:
			
			Repeated deny logs from same source
			Known malicious IP communication
			Unusual east-west traffic spikes
			
			Outcome:
			
			Detection of scanning, lateral movement
			🔍 4. Lateral Movement Indicator

Use Case:
Detect movement inside network

Logic:
Multiple internal connections across segments
Access pattern deviation



🔹 7. Dashboards & Visibility

Created dashboards for:

VPN activity trends
Authentication success/failure rates
Firewall deny/allow trends
Top talkers / suspicious IPs

👉 Focus: Make security visible

🔹 8. Security Improvements Achieved

✅ Centralized log visibility across systems
✅ Reduced alert noise through tuning
✅ Enabled real-time detection of threats
✅ Improved SOC response capability
✅ Built foundation for behavior-based detection

🔹 9. Challenges & Solutions
⚠️ Challenge: High log volume

✔️ Solution: Filtering + prioritization

⚠️ Challenge: False positives

✔️ Solution: Rule tuning + threshold adjustment

⚠️ Challenge: Lack of context

✔️ Solution: Enrichment (user, geo, asset)

🔹 10. Lessons Learned (Architect View)
Detection must focus on behavior, not just signatures
Logs without context are low value
SIEM success depends on use-case quality, not tool
Identity logs are the most critical signal
🔹 11. Future Enhancements
UEBA (User Behavior Analytics)
Integration with SOAR (automated response)
EDR/XDR integration
Threat intelligence feeds
🔹 12. Tools & Technologies
SIEM: Splunk / Sumo Logic
Log ingestion: Syslog, APIs
Firewall logs: Palo Alto / Check Point
IAM: Cisco ISE, Active Directory
Cloud: AWS logs
